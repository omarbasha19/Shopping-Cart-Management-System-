# Shopping Cart Management System üõí

## Overview üåê

The **Shopping Cart Management System** is a comprehensive project implemented primarily in C, designed to manage a shopping cart with a variety of features such as adding, removing, and updating products, calculating totals, and managing inventory. This project showcases advanced programming concepts, including data structures, memory management, and user interaction via the command line. 

A simplified web-based version is also provided to help visualize the core functionality of the system. The web version is intended as a visual aid to understand the main project but does not encompass all the advanced features available in the C implementation.

## Features of the C Program ‚ú®

- **Robust Data Management:** Efficient handling of product data, including addition, removal, and updating of products in the inventory.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Uses dynamic memory allocation to manage cart items and inventory, allowing flexible and efficient memory use.
- **Comprehensive Cart Operations:** Supports a wide range of operations such as adding items to the cart, removing items, updating quantities, and viewing the cart.
- **Inventory Management:** Includes features to manage stock levels, ensuring users cannot add more items than are available.
- **User-Friendly CLI Interface:** A text-based menu system provides a simple and clear interface for users to interact with the program.
- **Error Handling and Validation:** Robust error checking and validation for user inputs, preventing invalid operations.
- **Calculation of Total Cost with Discounts:** Dynamically calculates the total price, including applying discounts and handling sales tax.
- **File I/O for Persistent Storage:** Allows saving and loading of cart and inventory data to and from files, providing persistence across sessions.

## Web Version üñ•Ô∏è

The **web-based version** is a simplified representation of the shopping cart system, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to provide a visual understanding of the basic functionalities of the project but lacks the comprehensive features of the C implementation.

### Current Design üñºÔ∏è

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

### For the C Program:

- **C Language:** The core logic is implemented in C, using pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and data structures.
- **Standard I/O Library:** Utilized for reading inputs and displaying outputs.
- **File I/O:** For saving and loading data to and from files.

### For the Web Version:

- **HTML5 and CSS3:** Provides the structure and styling for the web interface.
- **JavaScript:** Handles basic dynamic interactions such as adding items to the cart and updating totals.
- **Bootstrap:** Used for responsive design and styling.

## Conclusion üìù

The **Shopping Cart Management System** is an advanced project that demonstrates key concepts in C programming, including data management, dynamic memory allocation, and file handling. While the web-based version serves as a visual aid to understand the core concept, the full functionality and depth are implemented in the C program. This project is ideal for those looking to explore advanced C programming techniques and understand how to manage complex data in applications.
